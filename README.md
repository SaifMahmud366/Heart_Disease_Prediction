# Data Analysis

### Data Overview
The dataset contains various medical features for heart disease prediction. Initial data exploration shows no missing values, making it ideal for direct model training without extensive preprocessing.

# Visualizations

#### Age vs Cholesterol Analysis

![Scatter Plot](Images/ScatterPlot.png)

This visualization reveals the relationship between age, cholesterol levels, and heart disease occurrence. The color coding helps identify patterns in disease prevalence across different age and cholesterol combinations.

#### Age Distribution

The correlation matrix provides insights into feature relationships and their impact on heart disease prediction.

# Model Implementation

### Data Splitting
The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

### Models Used

1. **Logistic Regression**
   - A fundamental classification algorithm ideal for binary outcomes
   - Simple yet effective for medical diagnosis
   - Implementation:
   ```python
   lr = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)
   lr.fit(X_train, y_train)
   ```

2. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
   - Advanced algorithm capable of handling non-linear relationships
   - Effective in high-dimensional spaces
   - Implementation:
   ```python
   svm = SVC()
   svm.fit(X_train, y_train)
   ```

3. **Random Forest**
   - Ensemble learning method combining multiple decision trees
   - Handles complex relationships and feature importance
   - Implementation:
   ```python
   rf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
   rf.fit(X_train, y_train)
   ```

     - More challenging to interpret

3. **Random Forest**
   - Pros:
     - Handles non-linear relationships well
     - Provides feature importance rankings
     - Less prone to overfitting
   - Cons:
     - More computationally intensive than logistic regression
     - Less interpretable than simpler models
     - Requires more memory

## Conclusions

1. All models demonstrated strong performance in heart disease prediction.
2. Random Forest showed slightly superior performance, likely due to its ability to capture complex feature interactions.
3. The dataset's clean nature (no missing values) contributed to the strong performance across all models.

## Future Improvements

1. Feature Engineering
   - Create new features based on medical domain knowledge
   - Implement polynomial features for non-linear relationships

2. Model Enhancements
